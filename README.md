# Snake Game

**SUBMITTED TO:** Engr. Godfrey Dulla

**SUBMITTED BY:** CONSTANTINO, VAN

UNGAY, JAENY ANNE 

### COURSE/SECTION: BSCPE 2D

### I. PROJECT OVERVIEW:


Introduce the project by providing context and explaining the motivation behind developing a Snake Game in Java. Discuss the educational or entertainment value it aims to bring fun and simplicity of snake game. In that project it calculate score and time.


### II. OBJECTIVES:

Clearly state the objectives of the project. This could include learning Java programming, gaining experience in game development, or creating an engaging and functional Snake game. 

### III. FEATURES:

- **Snake Movement:**
    Allow the snake to move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Control the snake using keyboard input. 
- **Food Generation:** 
    Randomly generate food on the game board. Snake grows longer when it consumes food. 
- **Score Tracking:** 
    Keep track of the player's score based on the number of food items consumed. Display the current score on the game screen.
- **Collision Detection:**
    Detect collisions with the walls, snake's body, and food. End the game if a collision occurs. 
- **Game Over Screen:** 
    Display a game over screen with the final score when the game ends. Allow users to restart the game. 
- **Change color when hitting certain points** 
    For example score 0 = green, 5= red, 10 = blue 
- **Pause/Resume**
    It will trigger when pressing space button



### IV. TECHNOLOGY STACK:

- **Language:**
Java Programming Language
- **Data Structure: Applied**
Linked List - represent the snake body

### V. TIMELINE:

**Break down the development process into stages or milestones. Provide an estimated timeline for each stage, considering factors like learning curve, complexity, and testing.**
- **Week 1 :** Set up the project, design basic classes (Snake, Game Board), and implement basic movement. 
- **Week 2 :** Implement food generation, collision detection, and game over conditions. Week 3 : Integrate scoring system, user interface, and finalize testing. 
- **Week 4 :** Polish the game, address any issues, and prepare for submission. 
- **Week 5 :** Checking. 


VI. **CONCLUSION:**

The goal of this simple Java dictionary program is to give users a quick and easy
way to look up definitions of words. To guarantee a high-quality final product, the
project will be developed iteratively, incorporating user feedback and testing on a
regular basis. creating a Java Dictionary application that is a dynamic and ever-
evolving resource for language enthusiasts, encouraging user contributions in
addition to being a potent word lookup tool.
