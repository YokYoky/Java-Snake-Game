### COURSE/SECTION: BSCPE 2D

### I. PROJECT OVERVIEW:


Introduce the project by providing context and explaining the motivation behind developing a Snake Game in Java. Discuss the educational or entertainment value it aims to bring fun and simplicity of snake game. In that project it calculate score and time.


### II. OBJECTIVES:

Clearly state the objectives of the project. This could include learning Java programming, gaining experience in game development, or creating an engaging and functional Snake game. 

### III. FEATURES:

- **Snake Movement:**
    Allow the snake to move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Control the snake using keyboard input. 
- **Food Generation:** 
    Randomly generate food on the game board. Snake grows longer when it consumes food. 
- **Score Tracking:** 
    Keep track of the player's score based on the number of food items consumed. Display the current score on the game screen.
- **Collision Detection:**
    Detect collisions with the walls, snake's body, and food. End the game if a collision occurs. 
- **Game Over Screen:** 
    Display a game over screen with the final score when the game ends. Allow users to restart the game. 
- **Change color when hitting certain points** 
    For example score 0 = green, 5= red, 10 = blue 
- **Pause/Resume**
    It will trigger when pressing space button



### IV. TECHNOLOGY STACK:

- **Language:**
    Java Programming Language


- **Data Structure:**
    Hash Map (keeps the data in pairs (Key, Value), which you can access using a
    different kind of index.)
- **User Interface:**
    Command-Line Interface (software that runs operating system tasks by accepting
    text input.)


### V. TIMELINE:

- **Week 1** (PROJECT SET UP DESIGN)
    Define project requirements and specifications.
    Set up the development environment (Java, IDE, version control).
    Design the program's structure and user interface.
- **Week 2** (IMPLEMENTING FEATURES)
    Put word search functionality into practice.
    Create the user interface that shows word definitions.
    Establish the system for incorporating new terms into the lexicon.
- **Week 3** (ERROR HANDLING & DATA STORAGE)
    Implement data storage for word definitions.
    Include error-handling components to make sure the program is reliable.
    To find and address possible problems, carry out extensive testing.
- **Week 4** (USER INTERFACE REFINEMENT & TESTING)
    Improve the user experience by making changes to the user interface.
    Conduct extensive testing to identify and fix any remaining bugs.
- **Week 5** (FINALIZATION)
    Finalize all the parts of the program/system
    Do a lot of error checking for possible errors
    Finishing touches

VI. **CONCLUSION:**
The goal of this simple Java dictionary program is to give users a quick and easy
way to look up definitions of words. To guarantee a high-quality final product, the
project will be developed iteratively, incorporating user feedback and testing on a
regular basis. creating a Java Dictionary application that is a dynamic and ever-
evolving resource for language enthusiasts, encouraging user contributions in
addition to being a potent word lookup tool.
