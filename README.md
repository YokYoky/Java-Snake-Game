### COURSE/SECTION: BSCPE 2C

### I. PROJECT OVERVIEW:

```
Create a Java dictionary application that is both comprehensive and easy to use,
enabling users to look up word definitions. The application ought to offer a user-
friendly interface, effective search capabilities, and the capacity to grow the
dictionary through user contributions.
```
```
II. OBJECTIVES:
```
- Build a reliable and effective word lookup Java application.
- Implement feature for word definition.
- Ensure a user-friendly and intuitive interface for a seamless user experience.
- Implement efficient data structures for storing and retrieving dictionary entries.

### III. FEATURES:

- **Word Lookup:**
    Users can search for their designated word to find with the definition of it.
- **User Contributions:**
    Allow users to contribute new words and definitions to the dictionary.
- **Offline Mode:**
    Can use the system without the internet.

```
IV. TECHNOLOGY STACK:
```
- **Language:**
    Java Programming Language


- **Data Structure:**
    Hash Map (keeps the data in pairs (Key, Value), which you can access using a
    different kind of index.)
- **User Interface:**
    Command-Line Interface (software that runs operating system tasks by accepting
    text input.)

```
V. TIMELINE:
```
- **Week 1** (PROJECT SET UP DESIGN)
    Define project requirements and specifications.
    Set up the development environment (Java, IDE, version control).
    Design the program's structure and user interface.
- **Week 2** (IMPLEMENTING FEATURES)
    Put word search functionality into practice.
    Create the user interface that shows word definitions.
    Establish the system for incorporating new terms into the lexicon.
- **Week 3** (ERROR HANDLING & DATA STORAGE)
    Implement data storage for word definitions.
    Include error-handling components to make sure the program is reliable.
    To find and address possible problems, carry out extensive testing.
- **Week 4** (USER INTERFACE REFINEMENT & TESTING)
    Improve the user experience by making changes to the user interface.
    Conduct extensive testing to identify and fix any remaining bugs.
- **Week 5** (FINALIZATION)
    Finalize all the parts of the program/system
    Do a lot of error checking for possible errors
    Finishing touches

VI. **CONCLUSION:**
The goal of this simple Java dictionary program is to give users a quick and easy
way to look up definitions of words. To guarantee a high-quality final product, the
project will be developed iteratively, incorporating user feedback and testing on a
regular basis. creating a Java Dictionary application that is a dynamic and ever-
evolving resource for language enthusiasts, encouraging user contributions in
addition to being a potent word lookup tool.
